This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial (`DEMO.ipynb`) demonstrating the usage of UC2-REST and Imswitch for CBL Microscopy. UC2-REST is an open-source project that provides utilities to control a ESP32 board for microscopy, and Imswitch is another open-source project that provides GUI options for controlling the UC2 board.
