    "This tutorial and demo will shows you how to get started with Imswitch and UC2 in Python. Imswitch is a software package that allows the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and interact with our hardware, the open UC2 Controller Board to turn on LED matrices or control the motors. The board itself will not handle cameras, these will usually be handled over USB. Most online tutorials will show you. how to flash the boards. This should already be done on the controller boards, but if not they can easily be reflashed with help of this page: https://youseetoo.github.io/ <br>\n",
    "But before reflashing your computer will require drivers to see the controller board. If the official openUC2 boards are used with a ESP32-WROOM-32D controller and shield, you will need the CP210x drivers: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads\n",

    "*Sidenote: also ensure that you are using a data cable. Charging micro usb cables will not be able to interact with the controller board. <br>*\n",
